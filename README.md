Work Scripts
============

Quick scripts and one liners.

1. Concatenate .csv files -- Python script to convert, clean up and concatenate some old report files into one large .csv files.
2. Parse Edifact -- (In progress) Python script reads in edifact files and export the values in a more readable format.
3. DiffReports -- DOS command to run multiple excel Report comparisons using [ExcelCompare](https://github.com/na-ka-na/ExcelCompare). Saves a bit of typing each time.
4. Number Distance Checks -- Python script that compares candidate ids to active ids (Hamming Distance), to reduce the risks of collisions due to read errors.
